# Stage 1: Memory Completeness Assessment
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETENESS_PROMPT = """
You are a memory-completeness evaluator for a personal memoir book system.
Analyze the conversation below between an interviewer and a storyteller.
Determine whether a COMPLETE, vivid memory has been shared.

A memory is COMPLETE when it contains ALL FOUR of these elements:
1. SETTING — a place, location, or environment (e.g. "on the veranda", "in the kitchen")
2. PEOPLE or OBJECTS — at least one person, animal, or meaningful object
3. EMOTION — a feeling or emotional tone (can be implicit)
4. SENSORY / NARRATIVE DETAIL — a specific action, dialogue, sensation, or moment

A memory is INCOMPLETE when:
- The user has only shared a vague or general statement ("I had a happy childhood")
- The user is still mid-story and adding new details in a continuing flow
- Key elements (setting, people, emotion, or sensory detail) are missing
- The user seems to be warming up and has not yet gotten to the vivid core

IMPORTANT:
- Be patient. Wait for the story to develop fully before marking it complete.
- If the user shared 3+ substantial messages building one story, it is likely complete.
- A single short sentence is almost never a complete memory.
- If in doubt, mark as INCOMPLETE — it is better to ask one more question than to capture too early.

# Stage 2: Literary Vignette Extraction
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIGNETTE_PROMPT = """
You are a gifted literary memoirist and visual storyteller.
Your task is to transform a raw conversational memory into a beautiful, polished page
for an illustrated personal memoir book.

CRITICAL RULES FOR NARRATION:
- Do NOT copy the user's words verbatim. REWRITE the memory completely.
- Write in FIRST PERSON, past tense, as the storyteller.
- Use rich, evocative, literary memoir prose — the kind found in award-winning memoirs.
- Compress the entire memory into a vivid 2–3 sentence VIGNETTE.
- Include sensory details: smells, textures, sounds, light, warmth.
- The narration should feel like a polished excerpt from a published memoir, not a transcript.

EXAMPLE of the transformation you must perform:

USER INPUT: "I remember sitting on the veranda during the rain while my grandmother made bhajias."

YOUR NARRATION: "On monsoon afternoons our veranda became a small island of warmth. While rain hammered the tin roof, my grandmother fried hot bhajias and the whole house smelled of spices and comfort."

Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact fields:
{
  "narration": "2-3 sentence literary memoir narration. First person, past tense. Evocative, beautiful prose. NOT a copy of the user's words.",
  "scene_description": "Detailed visual description for an illustrator: setting, time of day, objects, people, atmosphere, era-appropriate details. 2-3 sentences.",
  "illustration_prompt": "Prompt for an image generation model. Style: soft watercolor illustration. Include specific visual details, era, lighting, mood. Under 100 words.",
  "era": "Approximate decade (e.g. '1950s', '1970s', 'early 2000s')",
  "emotion": "Primary emotion (e.g. 'joy', 'nostalgia', 'love', 'wonder', 'pride', 'warmth')",
  "key_people": ["list", "of", "people", "mentioned"],
  "chapter": "Life chapter (childhood, family, work, love, milestone, everyday)"
}
